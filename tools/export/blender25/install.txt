Godot Author's Own Collada Exporter
-----------------------------------

1) Copy the "io_scene_dae" directory  to wherever blender stores the 
   scripts/addons folder (You will see many other io_scene_blahblah like
   folders). Copy the entire dir, not just the contents, make it just like
   the others.
2) Go to Blender settings and enable the "Khronos Collada" plugin
3) Enjoy proper Collada export.
4) If it's broken, you can:
   a) Flame the Blender developers in their mailing list for changing 
      the API every month.
   b) Flame the Blender developers for not giving a home to this script
      and mantaining it themselves, instead choosing to use the huge,
      bloated and buggy OpenCollada based implementation that is as big 
      as Blender itself, while this script is a little over 1000 lines 
      of code, works better and has more features.
   c) Cry to the poor Godot developers who are busy enough to fix it,
      because they are good people and will fix it for you anyway (submit 
      an issue to github).
   d) Be a Hero, save the day, fix it yourself and submit a pull request to
      github with the changes.
